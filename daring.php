  <p>With his casual look, his OSÃ‰(Z) style and the silhouette of a seasoned marathon runner,  Alain Tchana is clearly not a seasoned academic. His credo is to break with the codes and stereotypes of the traditional,  tidy and austere intellectual, even if it means that his colleagues, university lecturers, confuse him with students. A professor at Grenoble INP - UGA,  the young Cameroonian (39) embodies excellence in scientific research. Winner of several international prizes,   including the "Francophonie" prize for young researchers awarded by the Agence Universitaire de la Francophonie in 2022 (Napster),  he has become a benchmark in the world of computer science.

  In the academic world, freedom of expression and individuality are often emphasized as fundamental values.  However, when it comes to personal appearance,  many professors and education professionals prefer to adopt a  conservative style of dress. It is in this context that the example of a university professor who dares to dress differently from others becomes particularly interesting and revealing. This text explores the impact of this sartorial singularity on academia, students and the perception of teaching.
  </p>

  <p>The way a teacher dresses can also influence the perception of his or her teaching. A unique style of dress   can suggest an unconventional teaching approach, perhaps more dynamic and innovative. Students may be more inclined to engage and actively participate in lessons, attracted by the teacher's originality and creativity.</p>
